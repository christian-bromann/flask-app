# A Flask + Docker app operated by [Runme](https://runme.dev)

This project is a Flask application using Docker as container and Runme as operational engine. You could use this example app as a base for your new project or as a guide to Dockerize your existing Flask app.

The example app is minimal but it wires up a number of things you might use in a real world Flask app, but at the same time it's not loaded up with a million personal opinions.

For the Docker bits, everything included is an accumulation of [Docker best practices](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/best-practices-around-production-ready-web-apps-with-docker-compose) based on building and deploying dozens of assorted Dockerized web apps since late 2014.

**This app is using Flask 2.3.2 and Python 3.11.4**.
